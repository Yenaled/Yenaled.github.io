Welcome! I'm an aspiring physician-scientist currently in school at the David Geffen School of Medicine at <abbr title="The University of California, Los Angeles">UCLA</abbr>, with research interests in genomics, oncology, and bioinformatics. As of 2019, UCLA is ranked <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/university-of-california-los-angeles-04010">#5 (primary care) and #6 (research) in medical school rankings</a> in the United States, and UCLA Medical Center is ranked the <a href="https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area/ca/ucla-medical-center-6931755">#1 best hospital in California and on the west coast</a> of the United States. It is truly an honor to do my medical training at this wonderful academic institution.
