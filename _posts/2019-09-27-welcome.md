Welcome! I'm an aspiring physician-scientist currently in school at the David Geffen School of Medicine at <abbr title="The University of California, Los Angeles">UCLA</abbr>, with research interests in genomics, oncology, and bioinformatics. As of 2019, UCLA is ranked #5 (primary care) and #6 (research) in medical school rankings in the United States, and UCLA Medical Center is ranked the #1 best hospital in California and on the west coast of the United States.
